= shell-tester

A little library to create automated tests for shell setups.
When a test is run, it also generates a detailed output of the shell session,
which can be used to create screenshots or videos of the test.

I use this library to xref:dotfiles::index.adoc[test my dotfiles and generate example screenshots for my shell setup].
